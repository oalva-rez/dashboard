# dashboard
<p>This dashboard page was used to further develope my HTML/CSS skills. My biggest takeaway from this project was further practicing my css Grid layout skills. I wanted to successfully collapse the inner tiles into one column and create rows automatically which was challenging at first but after learning about auto-fit and auto-fill I was able to accomplish the behavior I was hoping for.</p>
